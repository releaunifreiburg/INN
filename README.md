# Breaking the Paradox of Explainable Deep Learning

Deep Learning has achieved tremendous results by pushing the frontier of automation in diverse domains. Unfortunately, current neural network architectures are not explainable by design. In this paper, we propose a novel method that trains deep hypernetworks to generate explainable linear models. Our models retain the accuracy of black-box deep networks while offering free lunch explainability by design. Specifically, our explainable approach requires the same runtime and memory resources as black-box deep models, ensuring practical feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our explainable deep networks are as accurate as state-of-the-art classifiers on tabular data. On the other hand, we showcase the interpretability of our method on a recent benchmark for empirically comparing prediction explainers. The experimental results reveal that our models are not only as accurate as their black-box deep-learning counterparts but also as interpretable as state-of-the-art explanation techniques.
